* Description
  This project was carried out for educational purpose, its main objective is to apply object detection and tracking on pedestrians and cars from [[http://jacarini.dinf.usherbrooke.ca/dataset2012/][CDW-2012 dataset]].
  It makes use of OpenCV library to detect objects using Haarcascade or background subtraction and then it tracks the trajectory of each object using different tracking algorithms (=opencv-contrib-python= was used because it implements more tracking algorithms compared to =opencv-python=).
* Build
  1. Install required python packages.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  pip install -r requirements.txt
#+END_SRC
  2. Download [[http://jacarini.dinf.usherbrooke.ca/dataset2012/][CDW-2012 dataset]] and extract dataset folder in the root folder of this project.
  3. Download [[https://github.com/Mogball/goturn-files][GOTURN pretrained model]] and extract =goturn.caffemodel= in the root folder of this project.
  4. Execute =app.py=.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  python app.py
#+END_SRC
